# ClockPunchingArkel

This repository contains a single-page attendance monitoring tool.

`Index.html` now combines the advanced punch monitor with a quick hours calculator. Upload CSV/Excel files to compute day and night hours or paste new punch data directly into the page.

The app is entirely client-side and requires no server.
